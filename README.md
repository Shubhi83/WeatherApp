A weather app is a web application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for a specific location. The app typically fetches data from a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. Users can enter a city name or use their current location to get the weather updates.
